Object of Play: 

- Step 0: Find the pile of Dog Poop 
- Step 1: Get there in as few steps as possible 
- Step 2: Spread the poop everywhere in one go 

Hint: Don't go anywhere twice, or your CHARGE runs out before you have 100% SPREAD. You need full spread to advance to the next level. 

Hint: Extra Points for more turns (grind that poo into the carpet!) 

Supports WASD and Cursor Keys.
